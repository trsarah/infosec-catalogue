The digitization of analog information and processes, as well as the resulting migration to an external Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and the utilization of cloud services, has gained significant importance in recent years. Consequently, IT security standards and guidelines must be implemented to protect confidential (business and customer) data from competitors and the public. To identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities or risks, it makes sense for Cloud Service Providers to implement certain measures based on national and international norms and standards and to undergo organizational certification.
Choosing the right certification can be challenging, given the multitude of different norms that also focus on various areas. Therefore, the goal of this master's thesis is to analyze standards and guidelines with respect to their specific focus points and generate a criteria catalog that can cover all relevant security topics. Subsequently, the developed framework will be discussed and validated with industry experts. This process aims to empower Cloud Service Providers to appropriately mitigate all necessary security risks in the future by implementing IT security standards based on the criteria catalog.
